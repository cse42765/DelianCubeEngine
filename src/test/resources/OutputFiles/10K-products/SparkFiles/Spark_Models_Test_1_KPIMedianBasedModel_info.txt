KPIMedianBasedModel
-------------------------

We run a simple KPI computation. THe rules are that a cell is (a) low if the measure value is below half of the median value, (b) high if higher than 1.5 of the median, or (c) OK otherwise
The median is: 4796.5
Each column of the result pertains to another class of the result set, with each row referring to the respective cell of the query result
